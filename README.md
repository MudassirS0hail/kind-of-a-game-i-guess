# kind-of-a-game-i-guess
makin this small java game for my semester project, the idea i got in my mind for this game is that there will be a couple objects or maybe circles that you have to click and they'll disappear, you will have a timer of one minute and you have to click on the maximum objects it's like setting up a high score
